                  Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session). <br>

                  Local storage has 4 methods: <br>

                  setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key. <br>

                  getItem() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the value stored with a particular key name. <br>

                  removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in reference to key. <br>

                  clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage. <br> <br>

                  Session Storage: <br>

                  Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. <br>

                  Session Storage has 4 methods: <br>

                  setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key. <br>

                  getIteam() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the value stored with a particular key name. <br>

                  removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in reference to key. <br>

                  clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in the session storage.

                  because what you have here is a local scope
                  other kinds of scope in java are class scope (for example), a member of a class has a class scope so it is accessible anywhere inside a class. <br>

                  the basic rules for scope are: <br>

                  1. The scope of a parameter declaration is the body of the method in which the declaration appears. <br>

                  2. The scope of a local-variable declaration is from the point at which the declaration appears to the end of that block. <br>

                  3. The scope of a local-variable declaration that appears in the initialization section of a for statement’s header is the body of the for statement and the other expressions in the header. <br>
                  4. A method or field’s scope is the entire body of the class. This enables non-static methods of a class to use the fields and other methods of the class. <br>

                  Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript. The two types of scope are local and global: <br>

                  Global variables are those declared outside of a block
                  Local variables are those declared inside of a block <br>
                   
                  the function is a local variable with the same name. By sending them to the console, we can see how the variable’s value is different depending on the scope, and the original value is not changed.

                  We’ll start with a somewhat of an odd claim — despite allowing async JavaScript code (like the setTimeout we just discussed), until ES6, JavaScript itself has actually never had any direct notion of asynchronicity built into it. The JavaScript engine has never done anything more than executing a single chunk of your program at any given moment. <br>

                  For more details on how JavaScript engines work (Google’s V8 specifically), check one of our previous articles on the topic. <br>

                  So, who tells the JS Engine to execute chunks of your program? In reality, the JS Engine doesn’t run in isolation — it runs inside a hosting environment, which for most developers is the typical web browser or Node.js. Actually, nowadays, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices, from robots to light bulbs. Every single device represents a different type of hosting environment for the JS Engine. <br>

                  The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                  undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined. <br> 

                  In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.) <br>

                  A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. <br>

                  typeof operator and undefined: <br>
                  Alternatively, typeof can be used One reason to use typeof is that it does not throw an error if the variable has not been declared. <br>

                  However, there is another alternative. JavaScript is a statically scoped language, so knowing if a variable is declared can be read by seeing whether it is declared in an enclosing context. <br>

                  The global scope is bound to the global object, so checking the existence of a variable in the global context can be done by checking the existence of a property on the global object, using the in operator. <br>
